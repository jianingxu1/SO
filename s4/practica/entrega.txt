29. The parent does the default SIGALRM treatment, it terminates.

30. The signal treatment table is change to the default one. The reprogramming of signals does NOT hold, the DEFAULT is placed.

31. It is concurrent, the parent does not wait to create the next child.

32. It can't because a process can only send signals to processes created by the same user and group.
bash: kill: (7453) - Operation not permitted

33. The process is killed because the default behaviour of the signal is to terminate the process.
In my case, as I use a SIGALRM to count each second: [1]    49325 alarm      ./eventos2

34. With 1 as a parameter, the SIGUSR1 signal that the parent process sends to the child process is received after the child has captured the signal.
With 0, the child process receives de SIGUSR1 signal before capturing it.
